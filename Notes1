All kernels are created in C language.

Every Open source projcts has EE ( Enterprise Edition) and CE ( Community Edition)

Upstream Projects are CE of Open source projects

For ex: OpenShift is the Upstream product of Kubernetis by Redhat

POD is SANDBOX with multiple containers

Problem with Docker:
to run a container you have to be root. With root you can access the os files which is a threat. Patching this issue or any other
issue, Docker takes lot of time.

Podman is another container by Redhat like Docker, is root less and very fast patching mechanism

Redhat created another layer on top of Kubernatis

To see the list of projects in Kubernatis/Openshift:

kubectl get projects
oc get projects



sudo - super user do


Install docker on CentOS 
using https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/

Whever you runs the container it always use the resources of the host OS

Kernel name space is 

Virtualisation Vs Contanerisation
__________________________________

VM=> have own OS, own kernel means there are lot of things you never use ( bloatware). Use hyperviser, which is used to create VM
    2 types ->
        Type1-Needs and OS
        Type2 -- No need an OS
AD & LDAP - used to authenticate the users
htpasswd - used to authenticate in the Master node

SDS - Software Defined Storage - In order to keep your data persistant 
SDN - Software Defined Networking


Routing:

To communicate between two containers or different pods.

-----------
oc logs podname
