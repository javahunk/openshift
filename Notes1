All kernels are created in C language.

Every Open source projcts has EE ( Enterprise Edition) and CE ( Community Edition)

Upstream Projects are CE of Open source projects

For ex: OpenShift is the Upstream product of Kubernetis by Redhat

POD is SANDBOX with multiple containers

Problem with Docker:
to run a container you have to be root. With root you can access the os files which is a threat. Patching this issue or any other

Redhat created another layer on top of Kubernatis

To see the list of projects in Kubernatis/Openshift:

kubectl get projects
oc get projects


sudo - super user do
